/**
 * Per-model camera capabilities, keyed on the BLE manufacturer model id (payload bytes [0:1], LE).
 *
 * Only the datalink UDP port and WiFi security actually vary across the Osmo line — pairing (the
 * "osmo" PIN), the `/v2` HTTP media API, and DJI_/CAM_ file naming are shared. Cells marked
 * [verified] were confirmed on real hardware: **Nano, Action 5 Pro, Action 6, Osmo 360 and Pocket 3** all
 * browse + download on 9004 (tester-confirmed). Everything else falls back to the most common config
 * (9004 + TCP-7001 poke + WPA2) so an unrecognized DJI Osmo is still *attempted* rather than refused.
 * Still open: the Action 4 pairs, but its AP never comes up.
