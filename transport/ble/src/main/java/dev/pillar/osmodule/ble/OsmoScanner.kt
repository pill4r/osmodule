/**
 * BLE scanner for DJI Osmo cameras. Scans with NO hardware filter (the Pocket 3 omits
 * manufacturer data, so a filter could hide the Nano) and classifies in software:
 *  - DJI manufacturer id present -> parse model id, log raw payload (this is how we learn
 *    the Nano's model byte);
 *  - name contains "osmo"/"nano" -> treat as a camera hit;
 *  - anything else -> counted, never named. See below.
 *
 * **Non-matching devices are never logged.** A scan with no hardware filter sees the whole room, and
 * this log is a file we ask testers to send us: one real run came back listing a neighbour's TV, a
 * named phone, smart bulbs and room names, each with its MAC. None of that is ours to collect, and
 * the diagnostic it was there for — "is BLE actually working?" — is answered just as well by a
 * count. If an unexpectedly-named camera ever needs finding, the count says the radio saw devices
 * and the fix belongs in [Brand]/[CameraModel] name matching, not in a log of the tester's home.
