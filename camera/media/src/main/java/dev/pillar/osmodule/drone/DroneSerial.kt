/**
 * Finding an aircraft's serial number, which the `0x51` session-open has to hand back before the drone
 * will serve anything.
 *
 * **Found by shape, not by tag.** This used to anchor on a `0x11` byte, which is what a Mavic 3 puts in
 * front of its serial — a Neo 2 uses `0x24`, so the search found nothing and the session could never
 * open, indistinguishable in the log from an aircraft that never beacons. Both serials are the same
 * length and the same alphabet; only the tag differs, so the tag is the one thing not to key on.
 *
 * A DJI serial is a run of uppercase alphanumerics ([MIN]–[MAX] of them) — long enough that nothing
 * else in a beacon looks like it. The longest such run wins, and the byte in front comes back with it,
 * because a response should echo whatever tag this aircraft used rather than a Mavic's.
 *
 * Lives outside `DroneSession` because the same beacon arrives on **two transports** in the inherited
 * Mavic 3 capture: the datalink over WiFi and GATT notifications over BLE, some 30 seconds earlier,
 * before the drone's AP even exists. See [inTunnelFrame].
