/**
 * A media session with an **Osmo camera** — registration, the CompositePack media list (`0x00/0x26`)
 * and every per-file command (delete, favourite, burst expand, highlights).
 *
 * This is the path `main` has always taken and the one every camera in the app uses. A drone shares
 * only the handshake in [DumlSession] and diverges completely after it — see
 * [DroneSession][dev.pillar.osmodule.drone.DroneSession].
 *
 * The datalink UDP [port] differs by camera family:
 *  - Osmo 360 / Nano / Pocket 3 = 9004, and need a TCP-7001 poke to arm it (`tcpPoke` = true).
 *  - Xtra Edge Pro (= DJI Action 5 Pro) = 10004, no poke (discovered via pcap; undocumented).
 *
 * After [fetchFileList] the socket stays OPEN: the Action 5 tears down its WiFi AP the instant the
 * datalink goes idle, so call [startKeepAlive] to hold it up during browse/download, then [close].
 * Blocking; call on a background thread. The process must already be bound to the camera network.

     * The camera needs a periodic beat to keep serving a browsing client, and playback mode is what it
     * drops without one. We used to send `0x02/0x8E` ~3x/s, which knocked the camera OUT of playback —

     * while holding playback is what breaks the mode. (Mimo does send it, just not where we did: a
     * capture of it deleting on an **Xtra** carries 486 of them and never enters playback at all,
     * while the same operation on a **Nano** enters playback once and sends zero. Per model, not
     * universal.) Removing it left no beat at all, and the mode then fell over
     * about a second after being set, coming back only on our own 10 s re-assert — observed on hardware
     * as "appears, 1 s, disappears, 10 s later appears again". With this at 1 Hz, playback holds for the

     * between Mimo's own sends (46237c41 → a8237c41) so they carry a counter or timestamp we don't
     * model; a fixed value is accepted.
     *
     * Note for whoever picks this up: Mimo's 1 Hz 00/88 is actually a DIFFERENT sub-command —
     * `1a 00 00 00 01` / `1a 00 00 00 00`, 5 bytes — and it sends the `0x17` announce only twice, at
     * t=0.115 s and t=0.595 s. Beating the announce is therefore not what Mimo does; it simply works.
     * The `1a` beat is untried and is the more faithful thing to test.
