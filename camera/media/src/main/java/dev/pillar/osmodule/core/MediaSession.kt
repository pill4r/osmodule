/**
 * A live connection to a device's media library — what the UI talks to, so it never has to ask whether
 * it is holding a camera or a drone.
 *
 * The two implementations have almost nothing in common below this line: an Osmo camera answers a
 * CompositePack manifest of paths and pages through a fresh playback session, while a drone must be
 * unlocked with a `0x51` handshake and then answers flat DCF records on the live session. Both are
 * "give me the newest page, then older ones", which is all the grid ever needed.
 *
 * Device-specific capabilities default to a no-op rather than throwing: a drone has no burst groups or
 * highlights, a camera serves its thumbnails over HTTP and never over the datalink. Callers can invoke
 * them unconditionally.
