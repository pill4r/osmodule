/**
 * How a device's media is located over HTTP — the one seam between the app's two, mutually exclusive
 * addressing schemes.
 *
 * | | path-based camera | DCF-indexed device |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | who | Nano, Osmo Action 5 Pro / Xtra, the 360 | Mavic 3 family; Osmo Action 1 ([DcfRecords]) |
 * | endpoint | `/v2?storage=N&path=…` | `/v1?file_index=…&file_subtype=…` |
 * | proxy | a sidecar file (`.LRF`/`.XRF`) at its own path | a **subtype** of the same index |
 * | impl | [PathAddressing] | [DcfAddressing] |
 *
 * The two implementations share no code — that is the point of the interface. [of] is the single place
 * in the app that decides which one a file uses, and it decides from the file's own origin: a record
 * that came out of a DCF manifest carries an index, one that came out of a CompositePack carries a path.
