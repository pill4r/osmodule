 * | media list | CompositePack TLV of paths | flat 94-byte DCF records ([DroneManifest]) |
 * | paging | fresh playback session per page | back to back on the live session |
 * | thumbnails | HTTP | HTTP — a video's THM, a still's from inside the original (see `DcfAddressing`) |

     * 4. app → `0x51/0x06` fl=0x40  UUID + serial

     * **Step 2 is the serial's real source.** Reading it out of the beacon instead is a per-airframe
