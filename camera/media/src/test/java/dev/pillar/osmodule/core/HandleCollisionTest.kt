/**
 * Delete addresses a file by handle, so two records sharing one is a data-loss bug, not a display
 * bug: the camera destroys whichever file it has under that handle and the grid drops the cell that
 * was asked for, so it reads as success.
 *
 * Real case, from a Pocket 3 tester's manifest — 43 records, only 11 with handles, two pairs
 * colliding, each a JPG sharing with the video shot seconds before it:
 *
 *     HANDLE COLLISION 0x00042ca0 shared by DJI_..._0715_D.JPG, DJI_..._0714_D.MP4
 *     HANDLE COLLISION 0x00042d80 shared by DJI_..._0729_D.JPG, DJI_..._0728_D.MP4
