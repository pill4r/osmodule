/**
 * Osmo Action 4 — the microSD list recovered from a tester's 2026-08-24 protocol capture.
 *
 * The first body to reach the grid whose model entry said it could not: `0x0014` was annotated
 * "pairs + BLE creds, but its AP never comes up (open)". This session pairs, brings up a **WPA2** AP,
 * handshakes on 9004, lists six files and downloads one. So the fixture is not only a decoder pin,
 * it is the evidence that retired that note.
 *
 * Two things about this camera are worth stating up front, because both would be guessed wrong from
 * the product name alone:
 *
 *  - **Playback entry is the Pocket 3's `0x01/0x01`, not `0x02/0x0c`.** The Action 4 answers `0x02/0x0c`
 *    with `0xe0` on every attempt; the control burst set its playback bit after 8 frames. An Action
 *    body on the Pocket route — the family split is not by product line.
 *  - **Handle geometry is the Xtra's SD geometry** (`0x00040000` + `seq * 0x10`), not the Nano/Pocket 4
 *    `0x40100000` + `seq * 0x40`. See [Op4ManifestTest] for the same surprise in the other direction.
