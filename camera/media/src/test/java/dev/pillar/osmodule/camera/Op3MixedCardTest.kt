/**
 * Osmo Pocket 3, 29 records — a **second** OP3, and a mixed card of videos and stills.
 *
 * From a tester's log of 2026-08-10. This is the card [Op3ManifestTest] said was needed: that fixture
 * holds videos only, so it could not settle why mixed cards showed handle collisions. This one has both
 * kinds on it, and the answer was neither theory on offer — not the camera reusing handles, and not
 * photos inheriting them, but our own scan reading across a record boundary. See
 * [no still carries a delete handle].
 *
 * It also disproves a naming assumption by counter-example. The other OP3 suffixes every file `_OP3`;
 * this one suffixes none. Same model, different *user* setting — so nothing may key off the suffix.
 * See MEDIA_PROTOCOL.md §1 on Naming Management.

     * The blob starts mid-record (`…749_D`), exactly as the tester's log carried it. Left that way on

     * It used to decode with two "collisions", each a still sharing a video's handle, and that was read
     * as camera behaviour — a photo inheriting the handle of the video shot beside it. It was ours. The
     * marker a handle hangs off sits before the path it belongs to, and the per-record window
     * deliberately reaches into the next record so the other fields can be found; a Pocket 3 photo has
     * no marker, so the scan walked past its path and matched the NEXT record's. Bounding the scan at
     * the record's own path leaves every still at handle 0 and every video with its own.
     *
     * It cost more than tidiness: the collision guard refuses BOTH sides, so two perfectly good videos
     * were undeletable because a photo had borrowed their handle. Nine files are deletable here, not
     * seven.
