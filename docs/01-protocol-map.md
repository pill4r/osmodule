# osmodule — DJI Osmo protocol map (BLE + WiFi)

Ground truth for how osmodule talks to DJI Osmo cameras with **no DJI SDK**. Everything here is
**hardware-verified** on an **Osmo Nano** and an **Xtra Edge Pro (= DJI Osmo Action 5 Pro)** unless a
line is explicitly marked *inferred* (from the open-source reference repos for the 360 / Pocket 3 /
Action 4-6, in `reference/`). Where the two verified cameras differ, the difference is called out; a
per-model summary table is at the end.

The pipeline is always: **BLE pair → get WiFi creds → wake the AP → join it → pull the media list over
the DUML datalink → fetch thumbnails/files over HTTP.**

---

## 1. Device identification (BLE advertisement)

The camera is found by a BLE scan on service `fff0` + its manufacturer data. The **model byte** (not
the brand) decides the datalink port and WiFi security.

| model | BLE name | model byte | notes |
|-------|----------|-----------|-------|
| Osmo Nano | `OsmoNano-XXXX` | `0x19` | DJI mfr id `0x08AA`; adv payload `19 00 00 <6-byte MAC> 03` |
| Xtra Edge Pro / Action 5 Pro | `XtraEdgePro-XXXX` | `0x15` | Xtra OUI `EC:9E:EA`, company id `0xAAF7` (vs DJI `0xAA08`) |
| Osmo 360 | `Osmo360-XXXX` | `0x17` | **9004 + TCP poke; WPA2 AP** |
| Osmo Pocket 3 | (BLE local name only) | `0x20` | *inferred*; broadcasts no mfr data |

The Xtra brand is a covert DJI shell company; the Edge Pro is a rebadged Action 5 Pro on DJI firmware
(confirmed by string/dexdump sweep of its app in `reference/xtra/` + live traffic). It resolves by its
model byte to the Action 5 Pro profile, so a DJI-branded Action 5 would behave identically.

---

## 2. Transport: BLE GATT

- Service **`fff0`**, characteristics `fff3, fff4, fff5, fff7`. Request **MTU 517** (notifications
  otherwise cap ~23 B; they reach ~256 B after the raise).
- **Write DUML commands to `fff5`** — *Write-Without-Response*. (Writing DUML to `fff3` is silently
  dropped — a known footgun.)
- **Arm pairing** by writing `[0x01, 0x00]` to `fff4`.
- **Notifications** arrive on `fff4` (and `fff5`). On the Pocket 3 *all* notifications land on `fff4`.
- BLE is the **control** channel only — it wakes the camera, pairs, hands out WiFi creds, and turns the
  AP on. Bulk data (media list, thumbnails, files) never goes over BLE.
- **Idle drop:** the camera tears the BLE link (`status=19`) ~5–6 s after pairing if the app idles —
  by design, you're meant to move to WiFi. `ConnectToWiFi` (0x07/0x47) both wakes the AP and keeps BLE
  alive a bit longer.

---

## 3. DUML frame (SOF 0x55)

The same DUML framing used drone-side, over GATT/UDP instead of UART.

```
off sz  field
0   1   SOF = 0x55
1   1   len_lo               ) total_len = 13 + payload_len (incl. both CRCs)
2   1   (ver<<2)|len_hi[9:8] ) ver=1  -> byte reads 0x04 when len < 256
3   1   CRC8 over bytes[0:3]
4   1   sender   = (sender_id<<5)|sender_type    ; App = 0x02 (id0,type2)
5   1   receiver = (receiver_id<<5)|receiver_type
6   2   msg id / seq         -- BLE: BIG-ENDIAN msg id ; UDP datalink: LE seq
8   1   cmd flags = (cmd_type<<5)|encrypt
        0x40 = request  0xC0 = response/ack  0x00 = notify
9   1   CmdSet
10  1   CmdId
11  N   payload
11+N 2  CRC16 over bytes[0 : 11+N]  (LE)
```

- **Address nibbles** (`(id<<5)|type`): App `0x02`, Camera `0x01`, Gimbal `0x03/0x04`, **WiFi
  subsystem `0x07`**, DM36x media proc `0x08` (`0x28`=id1, `0x48`=id2). "Target 0x0702" = App→WiFi.
- **BLE quirk:** the `[6:8]` field is a **big-endian message id** on BLE (verified across 3 impls); on
  the UDP datalink it's the usual LE sequence.
- **CRC** (identical to drone DUML, two equivalent parameterizations):
  - CRC8: reflected `init=0x77 poly=0x8C` ≡ spec `init=0xEE poly=0x31 refin/refout`.
  - CRC16: reflected `init=0x3692 poly=0x8408` ≡ spec `init=0x496C poly=0x1021 refin/refout`.
  - We vendor the unit-tested Kotlin impl from `dimadesu/dji-remote` (`DjiCrc.kt`).
- **`PackString(s)` = `[len:u8][utf8 bytes]`** — used for identifier / token / SSID / password.

---

## 4. Pairing (BLE, CmdSet 0x07)

App-level pairing replaces OS Bluetooth bonding — there is no numeric BT pairing.

```
1. write [0x01,0x00] -> fff4                     arm pairing
2. SetPairingPIN   flags0x40 07/45 -> WiFi(0x0702)
     payload = PackString(identifier) + PackString(token)
3. <- PairingStatus flags0xC0 07/45:
        00 01 = ALREADY PAIRED     -> proceed to WiFi
        00 02 = APPROVAL REQUIRED  -> camera shows the token on its screen for approve/deny
4. (if 00 02) user taps approve on the camera
   <- 07/46 flags0x40 payload 0x01   ← arrives as a REQUEST, not a 0xC0 response
   -> ack: 07/46 flags0xC0 payload 0x00
      The approval REQUEST is the "go" signal — treat it as pairing-complete and start offload.
```

- **`identifier`** = the string the device stores its approval **under**, so it recognises us next time
  ("already paired"). Any of the shapes seen work (15-digit or 32-hex UUID). Proven by experiment on a
  Mavic 3: rotating it on an aircraft that had been re-pairing silently for days forced a full approval
  round, and a known one skips it again. We send a **fixed constant on cameras** and a **per-install
  UUID, minted once and persisted, on drones** ([DronePairing](../camera/media/src/main/java/dev/konraditurbe/osmosis/drone/DronePairing.kt)) —
  a shipped constant makes every install share one identity and contend for a single remembered slot.
  Retries must carry the **same** identifier: `fff5` is write-without-response, so a first write can
  drop, and a retry with a different identity reads as a second app asking to pair.
- **`token`** — cosmetic on a **camera**, load-bearing on a **drone**. A camera displays it verbatim on
  first use and the on-screen *approve* tap is the real gate; we send `"osmo"` and the screen shows
  `OSMO`. A drone approves any token but releases WiFi credentials only for **`"DJI FLY"`**, so an
  aircraft paired under the wrong token looks successful and then hands out nothing.
- **Confirming without a screen.** A drone has no display: it flashes its LEDs and waits for a
  power-button hold — 2 s on most models, 3 s on the newest, while the **Mini 3** has no hold at all and
  needs three quick presses to enter QuickTransfer mode.
- The first-time `00 02` flow is confirmed on a factory-reset Xtra / Action 5 Pro. The already-paired
  `00 01` fast path is confirmed on both units. The handler must treat the `07/46` **request** as the
  completion signal — the `07/45 = 00 01` fast path alone only covers the already-paired case.

---

## 5. WiFi credentials, AP activation, and join

### 5a. Get the AP creds over BLE (CmdSet 0x07)

The camera hands out its **own AP SSID + passphrase** over BLE — no manual entry, no on-screen reading.

| dir | flags | set/id | name | reply payload |
|-----|-------|--------|------|---------------|
| →   | 0x40 | 07/07 | **GetWifiSsid** | `[status:1][PackString ssid]` (e.g. `00 12 "XtraEdgePro-2DCA16"`) |
| →   | 0x40 | 07/0e | **GetWifiPassword** | `[status:1][PackString passphrase]` |
| →   | 0x40 | 07/0c | GetWifiMac | `[status:1][6-byte MAC]` |

- **Verified on the Xtra / Action 5 Pro** (found by HCI-snooping the official app): query `07/07`
  then `07/0e` after pairing and the camera returns both.
- **Pace the two queries ~500 ms apart.** `fff5` is write-without-response, so a back-to-back second
  query drops, and the first must not race the pairing-approval ACK.
- The retrieved passphrase is **cached per-MAC** and never logged (only its length). It appears static
  per device. Falls back to a saved value / one-time prompt for any model that doesn't answer.
- Nano status: not re-verified against these exact getters, so it currently rides the saved-password
  fallback; the getters very likely work there too.

### 5b. Wake the AP

| dir | flags | set/id | name | payload |
|-----|-------|--------|------|---------|
| →   | 0x40 | 07/47 | ConnectToWiFi | `PackString(ssid) + PackString(pass)` — you send the camera **its own** creds; the AP comes up ~15 s later |
| ←   | 0xC0 | 07/47 | WiFiConnectResult | `00 00` = ok |

The AP **sleeps when idle** and must be woken per session this way. IP: camera `192.168.2.1`, client
gets `192.168.2.x` via DHCP. Security: **WPA2-PSK** on Nano, Xtra and the Osmo 360,
5.8 GHz.

### 5b-2. A camera that has never been activated has no AP at all

Out of the box, before anyone activates it, a camera pairs and talks normally over BLE and **keeps its
WiFi off**. Measured on a factory-fresh Osmo Nano:

| probe | unactivated Nano | activated Xtra |
|-------|------------------|----------------|
| `07/07` GetWifiSsid | *no reply* | `"OsmoNano-5A31"` after activation |
| `07/0e` GetWifiPassword | *no reply* | answers |
| `07/0c` GetWifiMac | *no reply* | answers |
| `07/19` GetCountryCode | `00 FF 46 46 00` — ASCII `"FF"` | `00 FF 45 53 00` — `"ES"` |
| `07/41` Wifi.OpenWifi | **accepted, status `00`, no AP appears** | — |
| `07/39` WiFi Get Work Mode | `e0` (INVALID_CMD) | `e0` |

So receiver 0x07 is alive and answering on the merits — the AP is what activation gates, not the
credential getters, and no 0x07 command brings it up. There is nothing to join and no password that
would help. Do not offer a password prompt in this state.

**Do not** use credential silence alone as the tell: an activated Xtra withheld all three while
pushing `0x00/0x99` at ~52/s.

### 5b-3. Activation itself — `0x00/0x32` (AMT.OneTimeVerify)

From an HCI snoop of the official app activating a factory-fresh Nano. The sub-command is payload
byte 0 (repeated in byte 1).

| sub | dir | size | contents |
|-----|-----|------|----------|
| `0x33` | ← | 55 B | **state push, 1 Hz** — `[33 33][18×00][state:1][len:1][serial]` |
| `0x35` | → | 135 B | body serial + a step counter (`0x22` before the write, `0x24` after) |
| `0x36` | ← | 154 B | per component: type byte (`08`, `0a`), component serial, **16-byte challenge** |
| `0x37` | → | 256 B | same component + an 18-digit token + the **16-byte response** |

`state` is DJI's `LctActivateState`: `0` not activated, `1` activated, `2` uninitialized, `3` factory
activated, `0xFFFE` not supported. A factory-fresh Nano pushes `02`; an Xtra in normal use pushes `01`.
**The push stops the moment the camera is activated** — 155 of them before, 1 after.

The camera issues a random 16-byte challenge and the app returns a 16-byte response, so the material
is minted by DJI's server (Mimo's `ActivateProto` wraps it as `ActivationResponse.contents[]`, a
repeated bytes field — two entries here, one per component). **Activation cannot be forged offline.**

Immediately afterwards the app sets the region — `07/18 SetCountryCode`, payload `FF <cc:2> 00`, e.g.
`ff 45 53 00`, reply `00`. Which of the two actually releases the AP is **still unknown**: both
happened within a second of each other. Worth one probe on the next factory-fresh body, because
`07/18` is unsigned and we can send it ourselves.

### 5c. Join from Android

- API 29+ **`WifiNetworkSpecifier`** → `ConnectivityManager.requestNetwork(...)` with a
  `NetworkCallback`. On `onAvailable(network)` call **`bindProcessToNetwork(network)`** so our HTTP/UDP
  sockets use the internet-less AP instead of falling back to cellular.
- Use `setWpa2Passphrase` for Nano, Xtra and the hardware-verified Osmo 360. The earlier inferred
  WPA3 setting made Android search for 32 seconds before its WPA2 retry found the 360 immediately.
- **Keepalive:** the AP drops ~10 s idle. Hold it with an active HTTP download, a UDP datalink
  handshake ping every ~2 s, or a TCP-7001 heartbeat (Nano).

---

## 6. HTTP media API

The camera runs **lighttpd/1.4.55**. Files are fetched by explicit path — **there is no
directory-listing endpoint** (any non-`/v2` URL is connection-reset), so the file list comes from the
DUML datalink (§7), not HTTP.

```
GET /v2?storage={0|1}&path=<path>      0 = internal, 1 = SD
HEAD supported (Content-Length) ; Range supported (206 partial)
```

- **Storage id is not in the list paths.** Auto-detect by HEAD-probing the first file at `storage=1`
  then `storage=0`; fetch the rest with the winner. (On the Nano test unit media was on SD = `1`;
  internal `0` returned 404.)
- **Thumbnails:** `MISC/THM/.../<name>.scr` (same storage id), served by `/v2`; the `.scr` decodes as a
  JPEG (`BitmapFactory` renders it directly).
- Both verified cameras are `/v2` servers. The `/v1?file_index=…&file_subtype=…&file_seg_subindex=…`
  form exists in DJI apps for other/older models; on the Xtra it is connection-reset. The older Osmo
  Action generation uses that endpoint with a different, index-based list — see
  [MEDIA_PROTOCOL §1](../MEDIA_PROTOCOL.md#1-get-media-list) ("Parsed — index-based"); code is parked
  on the `support-osmo-action-1` branch.

---

## 7. Media list over the DUML datalink (UDP)

The manifest is a DUML `0x00/0x26` request → `0x00/0x27` response over a **UDP datalink**. The port is
model-dependent:

| model | datalink | poke |
|-------|----------|------|
| Osmo Nano | **UDP 9004** | TCP-7001 pre-poke, then UDP handshake |
| Xtra Edge Pro / Action 5 Pro | **UDP 10004** | none (TCP 7001 refused; no 9004) |

The handshake payload is **identical** across models (`…seed… 64 00 64 00 c0 05 …`); only the port
differs. So the client tries the handshake on 9004 **and** 10004 and runs the file-list flow on
whichever answers.

### 7a. UDP wire format

```
UDP pkt = [8B udp hdr][12B routing hdr][DUML frame]
 udp hdr : (0x8000|totlen):u16le  session:u16le  seq:u16le  type:u8  xor:u8
   type  0x00 handshake / 0x01 telemetry / 0x03 acked-data / 0x04 ack / 0x05 command
 routing : last_cam_seq:u16le  this_seq:u16le  00000000  counter:u8  01 00 00
 seq rule: app UDP seq MUST start at (camera_channel + 8);
           camera_channel = heartbeat routing[8:10]
```

### 7b. Flow (Nano; the Action 5 is the same minus the TCP poke, on 10004)

```
TCP7001 poke -> UDP handshake (40B payload) -> drain heartbeats / learn channel
  -> devinfo   0x00/0x81 -> DM368:2 (cmd_type4)
  -> register  0x00/0x88 -> DM368:1
  -> init      0x03/0xDA -> Gimbal
  -> subscribe 0x00/0x99 -> DM368:1 (per-param)
  -> list      0x00/0x26 -> Camera:0
list req payload (page 1):
  4a00 2a10 010000000000 01000000 2d000d0100 ffffffffffffffff 0001000000000000 000000
```

Responses are `0x00/0x27` frames carrying the file list. Naming:

- **Nano:** `DCIM/DJI_001/DJI_<YYYYMMDDHHMMSS>_<NNNN>_D.<ext>` (videos `.MP4`).
- **Xtra / Action 5:** `DCIM/CAM_001/CAM_<YYYYMMDDHHMMSS>_<NNNN>_D.MP4`.
- Thumbs: `MISC/THM/.../<name>.scr`.

### 7c. Reassembly — strip the per-frame sub-header

The manifest is too big for one DUML frame, so it's chunked across ~17 `0x00/0x27` frames. **Each
frame's payload is `[10-byte sub-header][chunk]`**, where the sub-header is
`4A 01 xx xx <seq:u16-LE @6> 00 00`. `byte1 == 0x01` marks a data chunk; the bracketing control frames
are `4A 04…` (start) / `4A 03…` (end) — 10 bytes of sub-header, no chunk.

**Strip the sub-header (`payload[10:]`) before concatenating chunks in arrival order.** Concatenating
the raw payloads instead injects those 10 bytes mid-string wherever a path straddles a frame boundary
(`DCIM/DJI_` + `J….001/…`); the path is then unparseable and that one file silently drops — and which
file drops depends on packet layout, so the loss looks random run-to-run. The reassembled manifest
opens with a `u32-LE` file count. Don't seq-sort across pages: the per-file counter restarts per page.
See [`manifestBytes`](../camera/media/src/main/java/dev/konraditurbe/osmosis/camera/CameraSession.kt).

### 7d. Record layout

The reassembled manifest is `[u32-LE file count][record × count]`, **fixed-stride** records (Nano
`DJI_` = 361 B, Xtra `CAM_` = 272 B — constant within a device). Each record is an **enum block**
(carries the fps rational as `u32-LE num` + `u32-LE den`, e.g. `a8 61 00 00  e8 03 00 00` = 25000/1000)
followed by **length-prefixed strings**. Per-record signature:

```
… 0b "DJI"/"CAM" 00×9   8A 01 <idx>   … 12 01 00 13 00
  0d <len:u8> <filename>
  1a <len:u8> 00 00 00 01 <DCIM media path>
  1a <len:u8> 00 00 00 02 <MISC/THM thumb path>
```

- `0d` = filename tag; `1a` = path tag with a 4-byte discriminator (`…01` media, `…02` thumb); an
  optional `.LRF`/`.LRV` proxy is a further field.
- **Key fact: the media/thumb path fields carry NO extension — only the filename field does.** So a
  primary-extension name token (`_D.MP4` / `.JPG`, not `.LRF`) appears **exactly once per record**,
  making the filename the reliable record anchor and the leading `u32` count a checksum.

### 7e. Decode, don't scrape

[`decodeManifest`](../camera/media/src/main/java/dev/konraditurbe/osmosis/camera/CameraSession.kt) anchors on each
primary-extension filename, scopes that record's media/thumb/proxy paths and fps to its own byte window
(no cross-record joins, no `±220 B` fps guessing), and **asserts decoded record count == the header
`u32` count**. That assertion is the safety net — a record dropped by a reassembly bug fails the check
and logs, instead of silently shipping a short grid. It falls back to a whole-blob regex scrape
(`parseFlat`) for layouts that don't validate. Regression-locked by `DatalinkManifestTest` against the
real 45-record Nano and 13-record Xtra blobs.

---

## 8. What the manifest carries — and what it doesn't

- **fps: yes.** A rational `num/den` (den ∈ {1000, 1001}) just before the filename field —
  `25000/1000` = 25, `30000/1001` = 29.97; round to the nearest standard.
- **Resolution: no.** Pixel dimensions are in no field, and the KV enums can't separate resolutions (a
  2.7K and a 4K clip carry identical `0x2c`/`0x36`/`0x37` values). **Read resolution from the MP4
  `moov`** (`tkhd` last 8 bytes = width,height as 16.16 fixed) via the same Range fetch used for
  duration.
- **Size / duration: no** (byte-diffed newest vs oldest against ground truth — no field matches in any
  unit). Size from HTTP `HEAD` (`Content-Length`); duration from the MP4 `mvhd`/`tkhd` via Range
  requests (`HttpURLConnection` respects the process network binding, unlike `MediaMetadataRetriever`).

---

## 9. Low-res preview

- **Nano** lists a `.LRF` proxy clip per video in the manifest
  (`DCIM/DJI_001/DJI_<ts>_<seq>_D.LRF` — a 960×720 MP4 with `moov` at the **end**; ~0.6 MB for ~1 s up
  to ~95–190 MB for long clips). **Read the proxy path from the manifest, don't derive it** —
  extension/availability vary by model (`.LRF` vs `.LRV`, or none).
- **Xtra / Action 5** lists a `.XRF` file, they swapped the L for an X, which is typical for a dji shell company to do. Same as the Osmo Nano.
- Preview by streaming: `VideoView.setVideoURI("http://192.168.2.1/v2?…&path=<proxy-or-full>")`. Native
  `MediaPlayer` HTTP **does** honour `bindProcessToNetwork`, so it reaches the internet-less AP and
  range-fetches the `moov` off the end — any length, full scrub, zero download. Gotcha: a
  `visibility=gone` `VideoView` has no Surface and never prepares (no `onPrepared`/`onError`) — make it
  visible **before** `setVideoURI`.

---

## 10. Per-model summary

| | Osmo Nano | Xtra Edge Pro / Action 5 Pro |
|--|-----------|------------------------------|
| Model byte | `0x19` | `0x15` |
| Datalink | UDP **9004** (+ TCP-7001 poke) | UDP **10004** (no poke) |
| WiFi security | WPA2-PSK | WPA2-PSK |
| Creds over BLE | fallback (getters untested) | **verified** (`07/07` + `07/0e`) |
| HTTP API | `/v2` | `/v2` |
| Naming | `DCIM/DJI_001/DJI_…` | `DCIM/CAM_001/CAM_…` |
| Record stride | 361 B | 272 B |
| Low-res proxy | `.LRF` listed | `.XRF` listed |

Shared and model-agnostic: pairing (`osmo` token), the DUML frame + CRC, the `0x00/0x26`→`0x00/0x27`
list flow and its reassembly/decode, `/v2` HTTP, storage auto-detect, moov-derived resolution/duration,
and the streaming preview.

## 11. DJI drones (QuickTransfer) — the same stack, a different manifest

A drone reaches the *same* `0x00/0x26` → `0x00/0x27` list flow described in §7, but four things change.
Cracked from a PCAPdroid capture of DJI Fly ↔ a real Mavic 3 (2026-08-01).

| | Osmo camera | DJI drone (Mavic 3 `0x0070`) |
|--|-------------|------------------------------|
| Pairing token | `osmo` | **`DJI FLY`** — anything else is approved but gets **no WiFi creds** |
| Datalink | UDP 9004 (+poke) / 10004 | **UDP 9003, no poke** |
| List reply body | CompositePack TLV, carries paths | **flat 94-byte records, no filename** |
| Media URL | `/v2?storage=N&path=…` | **`/v1?file_index=<u32>&file_subtype=0`** |
| Thumbnails | HTTP `.scr`/`.thm` | **video:** HTTP `/v1` subtype 1 · **still:** EXIF `APP1` out of the original |
| Playback mode to page | required | **not needed** |
| Session | handshake → registration → commands | handshake → **`0x51/0x02` session-open**, before which the aircraft answers *nothing* |
| Delete / favourite | `0x00/0x28` / `0x02/0xbf` by manifest handle | **not available** — DCF records carry no handle |

The `0x4a` envelope is shared with the camera path, but note its length field is **12 bits with
`0x1000` as a FINAL-chunk flag** — reading it as a `u8` parses short frames correctly and silently
corrupts every long one, which is exactly where the manifest lives.

Record (94 B, newest first): `+0 u32` mtime · `+4 u32` size · `+8 u32` `file_index` · `+12 u16` duration
seconds (`0` ⇒ photo); fields past `+14` are unmapped. No name is transmitted;
`DCIM/100MEDIA/DJI_0554.MP4` is reconstructed from the index. Paging passes the **oldest index of the
previous page** as the cursor and the drone replays that file first, so callers dedup by index.

`file_index` is **packed, not flat** — mask the directory as 16 bits and the storage bits fold in, which
silently hides every file on internal storage:

```
bits 31:30 = storage (0 SD, 1 internal eMMC, 2 SSD)
bits 29:16 = DCF directory, 14 bits (100 -> 100MEDIA)
bits 15:0  = DCF file number (554 -> DJI_0554)
```
